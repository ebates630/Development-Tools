In this project, I harnessed the capabilities of both Visual Studio and Jupyter Notebook to develop a versatile simulation tool for generating random events. This collaborative effort between the integrated development environment (IDE) and the interactive computing environment allowed for a comprehensive and efficient development process.

Visual Studio served as the primary IDE, offering a robust and feature-rich platform for coding and project management. Its integrated tools and extensions provided a seamless development experience, aiding in the creation of a well-structured and organized simulation tool. With features like code highlighting, debugging, and version control, Visual Studio played a crucial role in streamlining the coding process.

Complementing Visual Studio, Jupyter Notebook was utilized to weave narrative and code together. This interactive computing environment allowed for the creation of executable documents containing both code snippets and descriptive text. Jupyter Notebook enhanced the project's documentation by providing an engaging and interactive way to present the simulation methods and outcomes. It facilitated a transparent and accessible communication of the project's intricacies.

The README file included in the project repository provides essential information about the project, offering a basic description emphasizing that the tool serves as a simulator for random events. It further outlines the methods and libraries pivotal to the tool's implementation.

For those interested in replicating the project on their local machines, the README furnishes clear instructions on how to launch and engage with the simulation tool. These instructions cater to users employing Visual Studio and Jupyter Notebook, ensuring a smooth setup process regardless of their familiarity with the project.

This collaborative utilization of Visual Studio and Jupyter Notebook showcases the synergy between a powerful IDE and an interactive computing environment, resulting in the creation of an engaging and accessible random event simulation tool.
